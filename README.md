# Enhancing Financial Time Series Prediction Using Temporal Fusion Transformers and Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT
Stock price prediction is critical for decision-making in the financial sector, with numerous factors such as market sentiment, news, and economic indicators influencing price movements. Traditional models that rely solely on numerical data often fail to capture the complex interplay between financial sentiment and stock prices. Recent research, such as the BERT-LSTM approach, has shown that incorporating textual sentiment from news can significantly improve predictions. By using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), a model designed for multi-horizon forecasting, along with FinBERT for textual sentiment extraction, we aim to create a more robust framework for stock price prediction. This hybrid approach will leverage both numerical financial data and textual sentiment, providing a deeper understanding of market dynamics
